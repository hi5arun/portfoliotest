# Portfolio (Creative Techy – Static)

This is a **no-build** GitHub Pages site using Tailwind CDN + AOS for animations.

## How to use
1. Upload these files to your repository (e.g., `hi5arun/portfolio`) at the root.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source**: Deploy from a branch → **main** → **/ (root)**.
3. Your site will be available at `https://hi5arun.github.io/portfolio/`.

Edit text directly in `index.html` (look for section comments like `Highlights`, `Projects`, etc.).
